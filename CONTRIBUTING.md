The code is under the BSD-3 license so do what you will with it.

If you wish to contribute fork and make a merge request. No real coding 
standard beyond making the code readable. I am trying to maintain compatibility
with the original VS Code Rest Client so anything that wouldn't work there with
regards to parsing the API files will be rejected. Otherwise have at it.

If you do add anything put your name in the acknoledgement section at the
bottom of the vim doc.
